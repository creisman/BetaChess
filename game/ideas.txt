make this capable of playing on chessTempo.

Update all procedures as optimized, todo, or slow.

I'd enjoy trying to generate a large perf.
  it seems like it's a classic map reduce problem based around how much you can increase the reduce step.

  first stage
    expand positons
      combine any duplicates

  one trick is duplicates can be from different generations
    if position yields X in 1, Y in 2, Z in 3... (maybe?)
