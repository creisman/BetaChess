I'd enjoy trying to generate a large perf.

it seems like it's a classic map reduce problem based around how much you can increase the reduce step.

first stage
  expand positons
    combine any duplicates

the trick is duplicates can be from different generations (if you "undo" a move) seems like I might be able to store this.
